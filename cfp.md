#### Call for proposals (CFP)

Today we are also opening our CFP! Submissions to speak at Pyjamas Conf 2022 will be accepted from 19th August 2022 **until 18th September 2022, anywhere on earth (UTC+12)**. All **talk slots will be 25 mins:** 20 mins plus 5 mins Q&A or 25 mins without Q&A. Since the conference runs for a full 24 hours, you can select the time zone that you would like your talk to be in. You can choose to **present your talk live or recorded** We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:

- who have never given a conference talk before,
- who are new to Python,
- who have built interesting things in Python,
- who have helped build Python,
- who wants to talk about the Python community, and
- who have the expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

If youâ€™ve never presented at a conference before and you think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! Pyjamas Conf actively welcomes and encourages new speakers to the conference.

#### Q & A

**How long is the talk?**

- All talk slots are 25 mins, you can either do a 20 mins talk plus 5 mins Q&A or a 25 mins talk without Q&A. All recorded talk videos must have length that is more then 20 mins but less than 25 mins.

**How will the talk be selected?**

- Talk proposals will be reviewed by our team of reviewers and selected by the organising team accordingly

**Can I give my talk recorded?**

- You can choose to give your talk live (if you are speaking in English) or recorded. If you are giving your talk recorded, we will need your recording (with English subtitles if not in English) to be sent to us by 20th November 2022.

**Can I give my talk in a language other than English?**

- You can give your talk in a language other than English, but you will have to present it recorded with English subtitles added. We will provide [veed.io](https://www.veed.io/) for you to do it.

#### Sign up to be a reviewer

Calling for reviewers for the PyjamasConf 2022!!! As a reviewer, your responsibility is to:

***review and vote for all the CfP within a week after the CfP closes***

It requires a lot of hard work but ***you have the power to choose which talks should appear in the PyjamasConf's Program***. We want to give the Python community a strong voice in deciding what the conference program should include.

As PyjamasConf 2022 is an online conference with talks and attendees across the globe the organizing committee will try to ensure that we have a representative sample of reviewers across the globe and with various backgrounds.
